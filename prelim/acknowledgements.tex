As anyone who has written a Ph.D. thesis will probably tell you, it's been a journey.
We laughed, we cried, we bled occasionally (though nothing too serious). A pandemic happened,
I learned how to make sourdough (see the appendix for more details). I learned how to ski, 
discovered a love for hiking, and ate large amounts of cheese. The list of people who I have 
met and shared deep and memorable experiences with is long -- I fear to list you all here in case 
I miss someone! -- but please do know that I treasure you. This is the beauty and tragedy of doing a Ph.D. half in 
Seattle, half at CERN: it allows you to build strong friendships with a large group of people, and 
then scatters you all across the globe. So to the Seattle friends, to the CERN friends, to the friends 
from undergrad, and high school, and even earlier, and to everyone in between, thank you for being a part 
of my life, and I hope to see you soon.

Of course, a thank you to my family for their continuing support, vacationing adventures, and for 
trying their best to learn physics along with me (my dad re: ATLAS -- ``This is pretty complicated isn't it?''). 

And finally a huge thank you to my group: Anna, for your guidance and support, and for always caring about 
me as a person in addition to me as a physicist. And Jana, for guidance and support, of course, but also for 
looking at/giving comments on almost literally every single one of my talks (even if you didn't 
always get my jokes).
