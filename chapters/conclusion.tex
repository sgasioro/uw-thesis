\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}

This thesis has provided an overview of the Standard Model, with an emphasis on pair production of Higgs bosons and how this process may be used to both verify the Standard Model and to search for new physics. An overview of the Large Hadron 
Collider and the ATLAS detector has been provided, and the design and use of simulation infrastructure has been explained, 
including work to improve hadronic shower modeling in fast detector simulation. The translation of detector level 
information to analysis level information has been explained, with an emphasis on jets and the identification of $B$ hadron 
decay. Finally, two searches for Higgs boson pair production have been presented, with a complete set of results for 
resonant production included, focusing on searches beyond the Standard Model, and a preliminary set of results for 
non-resonant production, targeting Standard Model production, with variations of the Higgs self-coupling. Two advanced 
techniques for the future of these analyses are further presented, along with proof-of-concept results.
