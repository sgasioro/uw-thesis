\chapter{Future Ideas for $HH\rightarrow \bbbb$}
\label{chap:future}

The searches presented in this thesis make use of a large suite of sophisticated techniques, selected 
through careful study and validation. During this process, a variety of interesting 
directions for the $HH\rightarrow b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ analysis were explored by this thesis author, 
in collaboration with a few others\footnote{Notably Nicole Hartman (SLAC), for spearheading much of the 
development and proof of concept work, in collaboration with Michael Kagan and Rafael Teixeira De Lima.}, 
but were not used due to a variety of constraints. We present two such interesting directions here, 
with the hope of encouraging further exploration of these techniques in future work.
