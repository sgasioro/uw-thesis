\chapter{Kinematic Reweighting for the 2018 Validation Region}
\label{app:reweight-plots}

The impact of this control region derived reweighting in the validation region for the 2018 dataset 
is shown in Figures \ref{fig:res-Validation18-1} 
through \ref{fig:res-Validation18-8} for the resonant search and Figures \ref{fig:nonres-Validation184b-1} 
through \ref{fig:nonres-Validation184b-8} for $4b$ and Figures \ref{fig:nonres-Validation183b1l-1} 
through \ref{fig:nonres-Validation183b1l-8} for $3b1l$ for the non-resonant 
search. 2018 is chosen because it is the largest subset of the data on which the year-by-year reweighting 
is trained. Generally good agreement is seen, though there are differences due to the application of 
the reweighting outside of the training region. As noted above, the bimodal structure in $m_{H1}$ for the 
non-resonant search is due to the definition of the validation region.
