\chapter{Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the \bbbb final state}

This chapter presents two complementary searches for pair production of 
Higgs bosons in the final state. Such searches are separated based on the 
signal models being considered: resonant production, in which a new spin-O or 
spin-2 particle is produced and decays to two Standard Model Higgs bosons, and 
non-resonant production, which is sensitive to the value of the Higgs self-coupling
$\lambda_{HHH}$. Further information on the theory behind both channels can be 
found in Chapter \todo{Fill in theory chapter.}

While the searches face many similar challenges and procede (in broad strokes) in a very 
similar manner, separate optimizations are performed to maximize the respective sensitivities 
for these two very different sets of signal hypotheses. More particularly, resonant signal 
hypotheses are (1) very peaked in values of the mass of the $HH$ candidate system near the 
value of the resonance mass considered and (2) considered across a very broad range of 
signal mass hypotheses. The resonant searches are therefore split into resolved and boosted 
topologies based on Lorentz boost of the decay products, with the resolved channel as one of the 
primary focuses of this thesis. Further, several analysis design decisions are made to 
allow for sensitivity to a broad range of masses -- in particular, though sensitivity is 
limited at lower values of \mhh relative to other channels \todo{Combination, bbyy} due to 
the challenging background topology, retaining and properly reconstructing these low mass events 
allows the \bbbb channel to retain sensitivity up until the kinematic threshold at \SI{250}{\GeV}.

In contrast, non-resonant signal hypotheses are quite broad in \mhh, and have a much more limited 
mass range, with Standard Model production peaking near \SI{400}{GeV}, and the majority of the analysis 
sensitivity able to be captured with a resolved topology. Even for Beyond the Standard 
Model signal hypotheses, which may have more events at low \mhh, the non-resonant nature of the
production allows the \bbbb channel to retain sensitivity while discarding much of the challenging 
low mass background. Such freedom allows for decisions which focus on improved background modeling 
for the middle to upper $HH$ mass regime, resulting in improved modeling and smaller uncertainties 
than would be obtained with a more generic approach.

Both searches are presented in the following, with emphasis on particular motivations for, and consequences
of, the various design decisions involved for each respective set of signal hypotheses.
