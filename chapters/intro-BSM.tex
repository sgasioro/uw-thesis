\chapter{Theoretical Particulars and Physics Beyond the Standard Model}
This thesis focuses on searches for pair production of Higgs bosons. Such searches are split into two 
major theoretical categories: a \emph{resonant search}, in which a physical resonance is produced that subsequently
decays into two Higgs bosons, and a \emph{non-resonant search} in which no physical resonance is produced, but
where the $HH$ production cross section has a contribution from an exchange of a \emph{virtual} or \emph{off-shell}
particle. Representative Feynman diagrams are shown in \todo{add diagrams}.




The searches presen
