\section{$m_{HH}$ Distributions}
\subsection{Resonant Search}
The final discriminant used for the resonant search is corrected $m_{HH}$. Histogram binning was 
optimized for the resonant search to be 84 equal width bins from \SI{250}{\GeV} to \SI{1450}{\GeV}, 
corresponding to a bin width of \SI{14.3}{\GeV}, and overflow events (events above \SI{1450}{\GeV}) 
are included in the last bin. A demonstration of the performance of the reweighting on this 
distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:res-cr-mhh} for the the control region and Figure \ref{fig:res-vr-mhh} for 
the the validation region. A background-only profile likelihood fit is run for the distribution in the signal 
region, and results with spin-0 signals overlaid are shown in Figure \ref{fig:res-sr-mhh}. Note that 
the plots show the sum across all years, but the signal extraction fit and background estimate are run with the 
years separately. Agreement is generally good throughout.

  The closure is generally quite good, though there is an evident deficit in the background estimate relative to the 
  data for higher values of corrected $m_{HH}$. Note that the spin-2 signals are significantly wider than the spin-0 
  signals. Near the kinematic threshold of \SI{250}{\GeV}, this leads to, e.g., the double peaked structure of the 
  \SI{280}{\GeV} signal, which is understood to be an effect of the limited kinematic phase space in this region.}

\subsection{Non-resonant Search}
As discussed above, the non-resonant search splits the signal extraction into two categories of 
$\Delta\eta_{HH}$ ($0 \leq \Delta\eta_{HH} < 0.75$ and $0.75 \leq \Delta\eta_{HH} < 1.5$), 
and two categories of $X_{HH}$ ($0 \leq X_{HH} < 0.95$ and $0.95 \leq X_{HH} < 1.6$). 
To maintain reasonable statistics in each bin entering the signal extraction fit, a 
variable width binning is considered defined by a resolution parameter, $r$, and a set range in 
$m_{HH}$, where bin edges are determined iteratively as
\begin{equation}
b_{low}^{i+1} = b_{low}^{i} + r\cdot b_{low}^{i},
\end{equation}
where $b_{low}^{i}$ is the low edge of bin $i$. The parameters used here are 
$r=0.08$ over a range from \SI{280}{\GeV} to \SI{975}{\GeV}, and underflow and 
overflow are included in the initial and final bin contents respectively. $m_{HH}$ with 
no correction is used as the final discriminant in each category.

A demonstration of the performance of the reweighting on distributions unrolled across categories is shown 
in Figures \ref{fig:nonres-4b-CR} and \ref{fig:nonres-3b1l-CR} for the control region and 
Figures \ref{fig:nonres-4b-VR} and \ref{fig:nonres-3b1l-VR} for 
the validation region. A background-only profile likelihood fit is run for the distribution in the signal 
region, and results with the Standard Model $HH$ signal and $\kappa_{\lambda}=6$ signal overlaid are shown for $4b$ in Figure \ref{fig:nonres-sr-mhh-4b} and $3b1l$ in Figure \ref{fig:nonres-sr-mhh-3b1l}. Note that 
the plots show the sum across all years, but the signal extraction fit and background estimate are run with the 
years separately. All bins are normalized to represent a density of Events / \SI{15}{\GeV}.

\section{Statistical Analysis}
The resonant analysis is used to set a 95\% confidence level upper limit on the
\HepProcess{\Pp \Pp \to \PScal \to \higgs \higgs \to \Pqb \Paqb \Pqb \Paqb} and
\HepProcess{\Pp \Pp \to \PGrav \to \higgs \higgs \to \Pqb \Paqb \Pqb \Paqb} cross-sections, 
while the non-resonant analysis is used to set a 95\% confidence level upper limit on the
\HepProcess{\Pp \Pp \to \higgs \higgs \to \Pqb \Paqb \Pqb \Paqb} cross sections for a 
variety of values of the trilinear Higgs coupling.

The upper limit is extracted using the \CLs method \cite{Read02}. The test statistic 
used is \qmu \cite{Cowan11}, where $\mu$ is the signal strength, and $\mathbf{\theta}$ represents the nuisance
parameters. A single hat represents
the maximum likelihood estimate of a parameter, while
$\doublehat{\mathbf{\theta}}\qty(x)$ represents the conditional maximum
likelihood estimate of the nuisance parameters if the signal cross-section is
fixed at $x$.


\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:qmu-def}
	\qmu =
	\begin{cases}
		-2\ln(\frac{\lhood\qty(\mu, \doublehat{\mathbf{\theta}}\qty(\mu))}{\lhood\qty(\hat{\mu},
		\hat{\mathbf{\theta}})})              & \hat{\mu} \le \mu \\
		0                                     & \hat{\mu} > \mu
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\CLs for some test value of $\mu$ is then defined by

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:cls-def}
	\CLs = \frac{\CLsb}{\CLb} = \frac{p\qty(\qmu \ge \qmuobs | s + b)}{p\qty(\qmu \ge \qmuobs | b)},
\end{equation}

where the $p$-values are calculated in the asymptotic approximation
\cite{Cowan11}, which is valid in the large sample limit.

The signal cross-section {$\mu$}~\si{\femto\barn} is excluded at the 95\% confidence level if $\CLs < 0.05$.

\section{Results}
Figure \ref{fig:res-limits} shows the expected limit for the spin-0 and spin-2 resonant search. The 
resolved channel covers the range between \SIlist{251;1500}{\GeV} and is combined with the boosted channel between 
\SIlist{900;1500}{\GeV}. The boosted channel then extends to \SI{5}{\TeV}. All results use the asymptotic approximation, 
though the validity of such an approximation for the boosted results above \SI{3}{\TeV} is being studied. 
The most significant excess is seen for a signal mass of \SI{1100}{\GeV}, with local significance of 
$2.6\sigma$ for the spin-0 signal and 
$2.7\sigma$ for the spin-2 signal. This is reduced to $1.0\sigma$ and $1.2\sigma$ globally. 

The spin-2 bulk Randall-Sundrum model with $k/\overline{M}_{\mathrm{Pl}} = 1$ is excluded for 
graviton masses between \SIlist{298;1440}{\GeV}.

    that all results use the asymptotic approximation, though the validity of this approximation for the boosted results 
    above \SI{3}{\TeV} is being evaluated.}

Preliminary results are presented here for the gluon-gluon fusion non-resonant search, combining results from the $4b$ 
and $3b+1l$ signal regions in the $2\times 2$ category scheme in $\Delta \eta_{HH}$ and $X_{HH}$. These results will be 
further combined with a VBF channel as discussed, but this is left for future work. Results shown here include 
background all background uncertainties, but do not include signal systematics. Limits are set for $\kappa_{\lambda}$ 
values from $-20$ to $20$. 
The cross section limit for $HH$ production is set at \SI{140}{\fb} (\SI{180}{\fb}) observed (expected), 
corresponding to an observed (expected) limit of $4.4$ ($5.9$) times the Standard Model prediction 
(see Table \ref{tbl:SM-HH-limits}). 
$\kappa_{\lambda}$ is constrained to be within the range $-4.9 \leq \kappa_{\lambda} \leq 14.4$ observed 
($-3.9 \leq \kappa_{\lambda} \leq 10.9$ expected). These results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:nonres-limits}.

\end{tabular}
 \caption{\label{tbl:SM-HH-limits} Limits on Standard Model $HH\rightarrow \bbbb$ production, presented in units of the

\end{table}

We note that this is a significant improvement over the early Run 2 result, which achieved an observed (expected) 
limit of 12.9 (20.7) times the Standard Model prediction. The dataset is 4.6 times larger, and a naive scaling 
of the early Run 2 result (Poisson statistics $\implies$ a factor of $1/\sqrt{4.6}$) would predict an observed (expected)
limit of 6.0 (9.7) times the Standard Model. The result of 4.4 (5.9) observed (expected) presented here is 
therefore both an improvement by a factor of 3 (3.5) over the previous result and also beats the statistical 
scaling by around 30 (40)~\%, demonstrating the impact of the various analysis improvements presented here. We 
note again that these results do not include the complete set of uncertainties -- however we expect the addition 
of the remaining uncertainties to have no more than a few percent impact.

    with a star. The \(\pm 1\sigma\) and \(\pm 2\sigma\) ranges for the expected limits are shown in the colored bands. 
    The cross section limit for $HH$ production is set at \SI{140}{\fb} (\SI{180}{\fb}) observed (expected), 
    corresponding to an observed (expected) limit of $4.4$ ($5.9$) times the Standard Model prediction. 
    $\kappa_{\lambda}$ is constrained to be within the range $-4.9 \leq \kappa_{\lambda} \leq 14.4$ observed 
    ($-3.9 \leq \kappa_{\lambda} \leq 10.9$ expected). The nominal \(H \rightarrow b\bar{b}\) branching ratio is 
    taken as 0.582. We note that the excess present for $\kappa_{\lambda}\geq 5$ is thought to be due to a low mass 
    background mis-modeling, present due to the optimization of this analysis for the Standard Model point, and is not present in more sensitive channels in this same region (e.g. $HH\rightarrow bb\gamma\gamma$).
  }
\end{figure}

The observed limits presented in Figure \ref{fig:nonres-limits} are consistently above the $2\sigma$ band for values of 
$\kappa_{\lambda} \geq 5$, peaking at a local significance of $3.8\sigma$ for $\kappa_{\lambda} = 6$. 
As this analysis is optimized for points near the Standard Model, and as there is no excess present in more 
sensitive channels in this same region (e.g. $HH\rightarrow bb\gamma\gamma$\todo{include comparison}), we do 
not believe this is a real effect, but is rather due to a mis-modeling of the background at low mass, where 
the $\min{\Delta R}$ pairing 
has poor signal efficiency and the assumption of well behaved background in the mass plane breaks down. This is 
consistent with the location of the $\kappa_{\lambda} = 6$ signal in $m_{HH}$, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:nonres-sr-mhh-4b} and \ref{fig:nonres-sr-mhh-3b1l}.
It was considered, but not implemented, for this analysis to impose a cut on $m_{HH}$ near $350$ or \SI{400}{\GeV} to avoid such a low mass modeling issue.

To check the impact of if we would have imposed such a cut, and to verify that the excess is due to the low mass regime, 
we therefore run the same set of limits without the low mass bins. In this case, we choose to simply drop the 
first few bins in $m_{HH}$ such that everything else, including the higher mass bin edges, is kept the same. Due to 
the variable width binning, this corresponds to an $m_{HH}$ cut of \SI{381}{\GeV}. The results of this check are shown 
in Figure \ref{fig:nonres-limits-with-cut}, and the corresponding limits for Standard Model $HH$ are 
quoted in Table \ref{tbl:SM-HH-limits-mhh-cut}.
With the $m_{HH}$ cut imposed, there is a slight degradation in the expected limits for larger positive and negative 
values of $\kappa_{\lambda}$, but the points near the Standard Model are nearly identical. Further, the observed excess 
is significantly reduced, with observed limits for $\kappa_{\lambda} \geq 5$ now falling entirely within the expected 
$1\sigma$ band. Due to the preliminary nature of these results, further study is left for future work. However, 
we believe, in conjunction with the $HH\rightarrow bb\gamma\gamma$ results and our expectations about the difficulty 
of the background estimation at low mass, that this is demonstrative of a mis-modeling rather than a real excess.

  dropping $m_{HH}$ bins below \SI{381}{\GeV}, with the value 
  of \SI{381}{\GeV} determined by the optimized variable width binning. All other aspects of the procedure 
  and inputs are kept the same as in Figure \ref{fig:nonres-limits}. The excess 
  at and above $\kappa_{\lambda} = 5$ is significantly reduced, demonstrating that such an excess is driven by 
  low mass. Notably, there is minimal impact on the expected sensitivity with this $m_{HH}$ cut.
